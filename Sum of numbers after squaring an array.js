const squareSum = numbers => numbers.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num * num, 0)

//function squareSum(numbers){
//    return numbers.reduce(function(sum, num){
//        return sum + (num * num);
//    }, 0);
//}
//This is the solution I was attempting to create but I seem to have made a few syntactical errors in describing this function however the logic was solid.
